RADYO PI TODO LIST:
============================


- convert volume into events
- Write code to read volume from potentiometer
- standardize names and process
- on pi reboot start mpd service, cd to radyo pi and start the script 
- Design box ideas with measurement, sockets exposed
- Build a cardbox housing
- wire up the on/off switch from encoder to gpio pins
- Make the indicators "light up" with color on tune in - sprite sheet
- Solder the potentiometer
- Portability: wireless setup via python - ssid scan, enter password
- write document for installation with installation for dependencies
  (jessie, setup wifi(ssid/apssword)- or used cabled connection, install mpd/mpc)
  (RPi, feedparser, Queue, python3, pygame) - use pip
  (on pc simulation mode use keys q- f- arrows-)
  (adafruit parts, extra extension, rotary encoder, )
- on Encoder push button turn off screen backlight - code gpio listener for this
- Find(Write) code to show temperature parsed on clock screen
- Start and end markers on the dial
- on the dial show station details from mpc parsing
- Make the sound card work?
- Do I  need an amp to connect a speaker? maybe buy mini speakers?
- Experiment with look and feel,  play with the font, glass front needed?
- Dim the backlight - too bright  *  this seems to be more difficukt than expected



DONE
==============================

- station location be based on the location of the last baloon, not station name
- select /dev/fb1 based on existence
- Get rid of mouse pointer
- Connect the encoder
- Write code to read encoder left turn or right turn
- convert the encoder into events
- Write code to show clock when off -  news headline parse
- remmeber the last delta/station location and volume level between the switch on-off
- change the clock background to a plain img file/darker
- create long living objects with lifecycles consistently
- on OFF/ON action generate event and display OFF screen/ON screen
- Write code to read on off from potentiometer
- on radyo end clean up resources etc
- do not recreate clock
- initial volume when started shd be higher
